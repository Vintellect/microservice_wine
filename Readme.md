# User Management

This service is responsible for handling user-related operations within our infrastructure. It provides functionality for user registration, authentication, and user profile management.

## Deployment Instructions

To deploy the User Management service, start by copying the example application configuration:

```sh
cp example.app.yml app.yml
```

Next, you need to update the following variables in the `.env` file:

```yml
USER_MICROSERVICES: "YOUR-URL-USER-MANAGMENT"
SPANNER_INSTANCE: "YOUR-SPANNER_INSTANCE"
SPANNER_DATABASE: "YOUR-WINE-DATABASE"
```

Replace the placeholders (`YOUR-URL-USER-MANAGMENT`, `YOUR-SPANNER_INSTANCE`, and `YOUR-WINE-DATABASE`) with your actual service URL, Spanner instance name, and Spanner database name, respectively.
